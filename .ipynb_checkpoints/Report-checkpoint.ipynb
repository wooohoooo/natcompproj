    "## Specific Goals of the Work\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Models?**\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is often used to facilitate decision making. Knowing what value a product is likely to have in certain market, for example, is going to influence pricing, marketing and future planning. These kinds of predictions are plentiful, and modern ML has come a long way from (only) being able to predict linear relationships between variables to superior models such as complex decision trees, that can model complicated combinations and interactions between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Uncertainty?**\n",
    "However, classically and due to certain restrictions such as tractability, ML has been focussed on predicting a point value rather than a range of values; while this is enough to make decisions in which do not depend in the actual value too much, it is a great restriction for situations in which we want to make a decision that is as well-informed as possible. \n",
    "In a situation like this, we would prefer not only a point estimate, but also an estimation of *how likely it is that the actual value is going to fall close to this point*. Imagine making the decision of selling a house: the seller would be more at ease with his sale knowing that the outcome will likely fall between 480.000 and 520.000 than if the prediction is just 'something between one and a million'. Essentially, what we try to capture with this spread of values (one particular implementation of this concept is the *standard deviation* of a normal distribution) is the *risk* we are taking by relying on the prediction. This obviously has other use cases, be it in medicine, game-playing or any other kind of situation that involves committing to one course of action over another. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more infuential branches of statistical thinking, so called Bayesianism, has promoted the need for having a full distribution over possible values, and with it predictive uncertainty, for years and years. However, while bayesian models exist (there are equivalents for linear regression for example) and things like Bayesian Networks and Gaussian Processes rival 'classical, or 'frequentist' approaches on a regular basis, they come with certain limitations, such as necessitating the specification of a prior as well as intractability for more complext models. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What are Ensembles?**\n",
    "In recent years, two particular branches of machine learning have gathered wide spread attention: So-called 'Deep Learning', which in its roots intended to mimic the human brain by constructing vast networks of artificial neurons that propagate signals through different layers until a prediction is found (others have called them stacked logistic regressions, and there is a point to be made for this particular description, too). The other are ensembles, groups of models that are combined in order to make a better prediction than any one model would be able to alone (see the computation of why they are better in voing for example; see Concordets Jury theorem). [Footnote: There seem to be deep connection between ensembling and certain kinds of neural network mehtodologies, such as dropout, which is sometimes referred to as 'ensembling with extreme parameter sharing'. This will be interesting in the discussion].\n",
    "While Deep Learning gathers all the (public) interest of research and media, ensembling has established itself as a collection of methods that are being used in practice as well as in ML competitions; as is evident by posts like this one: https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/want-to-win-at-kaggle-pay-attention-to-your-ensembles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**what is this work about**\n",
    "After reviewing a sample from the literature on ensembling, uncertainty and the combination of both, the current project aims to investigate the possibility to extract uncertainty information from ensembles in regression in addition to a point estimate of the predictive value. In order to do so, a very simple addtion is being made: When computing the predictive mean by averaging the predictions of the ensemble members, we also compute the standard deviation of this sample of predictions in order to obtain an approximation of the dostribution over values that the ensemble would deem likely. This way of obtaining uncertainty does not suffer limitations which has long plagued approaches that utilise full distributions over parameters (see bayesian models), such as intractability. The uncertainty that is obtained that way is being tested with several indicator values on the 'quality of uncertainty' that is being delivered.\n",
    "Additionally, in the discussion part, some more intricate consequences of this approach are being spproached, including a short primer on priors on ensembles as well as on what kinds of uncertainty we are reporting in our case and finally, an outlook on how this methodology might be used in combination with complex models such as deep learning, what the addition of uncertainty could bring to the table in applications and finally, how this work could be improved upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# THIS IS approximately one page\n",
    "\n",
    "[such as: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? this is a distribution over how likely the model thinks the values are, obviously this changes a lot when we change the model (see e.g. the mixed model ensemble with and without linear component!), how do we utilise the information to e.g. choose ensemble members (adding and removing members from this prediction is easy - just do or do not use their prediction in the final outcome). This could be determined e.g. by seeing if both the error of the ensemble goes down by removing the member, but also by looking at the quality of uncertainty before and after - removing a member that contributes to error but also makes sure the predictive uncertainty is more finely attuned to the case might indicate that it DOES indeed have some information that is useful in many contexts).]\n",

Thus we take the predictive mean - the mean of all the predictions - and use that as our final prediction. However, it is possible to extract uncertainty information from this group of experts: If they are all kind of recommending the same thing, it is likely that the optimal recommendation is somewhere close to the value. If all eperts vastly disagree, we can assume that there is not enough information in the Data they have seen, or that the structure of their studies isn't enough, or that there is something wrong otherwise.

I had a lot of fun doing this, however, because I had to do it next to a full time job while also not neglecting my family and friends, I believe with an extra week I could have done a bit more (test more kinds of ensembles, do the leap to deep learning properly, test more datasets, find more suiting mearuement variables and most of all, get this all in a bit of a nicer form). Overall, it was a nice experience, and since I do not depend on the grade that much (since I had to also do the assignments alone, which is a bit much for one), I am ok with what I put up here. I am very much looking forward to some feedback and ideas, I think this will be (at least part of) what I will focus on during further studies.\n"
