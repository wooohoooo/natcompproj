Hi!

1. ensemble.py contains all the important code. BaseEnsemble implements all the helper functions for things like plotting that are useful in an ensemble. The ensembles themselves are implemented relatively straight forward.

2. Report.ipynb contains the report

3. ensembles.ipynb contains test runs of each ensemble over each of the used datasets including visualisations of performance and predictive uncertainty. It is nice to get a feel for what is happening in each ensemble. 

4. repeated results.ipynb contains the experiments performed to find each models performance measures. It contains plots of each of the quantities as well as a thorough description of the process. Each experiment was run 100 times to make sure the outcomes are at least a somewhat convincing draw of samples of possible outcomes.



x. helpers.py so far only contains a shuffling mechanism that isn't actually used.
